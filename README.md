The project's core objective was to enhance airline passenger satisfaction by developing a predictive model to classify passenger feedback as positive or negative. In cases of negative feedback, the model aimed to promptly address concerns. This project facilitated extensive engagement with passenger feedback data, providing insights into sentiment analysis techniques. Our approach encompassed diverse machine learning methods, including Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), allowing us to identify patterns and draw conclusions based on achieved accuracies.

The dataset used can be accessed at (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction), also available within this repository. A notable challenge was the imbalanced class distribution in passenger feedback categories. We documented results for scenarios involving class imbalance and implemented strategies like upsampling to tackle this challenge effectively.
